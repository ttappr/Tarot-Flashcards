                 might have to use ::slotted() in the rules above to force
                 it to fit in the rows. Within deck-panel, the image and text
                 don't need tricky rules.. just use standard css to center
                 the image when the back isn't show.. then shrink the image and
                 float it left and have the text wrap around it.
